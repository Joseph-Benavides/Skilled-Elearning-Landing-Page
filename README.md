- Receive an error message when the form is submitted if:
  - The `Email address` field is empty should show "Oops! Please add your email"

## My Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- DOM
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

With this project I was able to work on the moblie-first workflow and further adjust the code to fit across all devices to deliver a great responsive web product/services. 

### Continued Development

On future projects I will focus on using JavaScript and the DOM to create more complex interactive sites. I will also continue to refine my responsive web design skills in order to execute it in a quicker manner.
